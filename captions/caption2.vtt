find Captain Toxicbet who went missing

32
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.560
after his territory was seized by the invaders

33
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.860
of the Red Bull Tank Regime.

34
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.600


35
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.820


36
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.680


37
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:58.790


38
00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.979


39
00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.200

troops.

45
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.120
so the controls are easy too. eh.

46
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.239
don't don't.

47
00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.980
I used to drive warships.

48
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.739
but it turns out that the controls are easy

49
00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.459
too here. right?

50
00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.860

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.360
or what. the scenery is really good.

52
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.180

at the Harapan Indah warteg.

55
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.400
how come your tank is longer than

56
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.760
my captain. uh. Captain. that's my tank again.

57
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.500
because it fits the size according

58
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.959
to the size.

59
00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.760


60
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.400

128
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.340
[Music]

Colbert your area will be back in

138
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.840

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.660
you give permission for a briefing first with viewers at

140
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.479
home

141
00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:56.460
Hello candidates  tank commander. yes. after

142
00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.199
3 great battles. we

143
00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:00.840
use warships which

144
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.300
are extraordinary Instance and exciting in

145
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.860
this episode for those of you who are curious. Don't

146
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.960
forget to also check this time.

147
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.580
we will fight

148
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.780
using tanks

149
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.039
before we go down to the

150
00:08:14.039 --> 00:08:16.680
real battlefield here  Captain

151
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.900
SKUT will tell you some

152
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.599
basic techniques about tanks first. yes.

153
00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:24.000
in front of this is your garage or depot.

154
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.879
where you will see

155
00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:28.979
which tanks are yours. Here.

156
00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:31.319
you can choose from 5 different classes of

157
00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:33.059
tanks. starting from the lowest.

158
00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.399
namely light.  the tank is the light tank

159
00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:36.779
that is the most ke  cil but the lightest

160
00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:38.880
and has very fast maneuvers.

161
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.919
this is very good for

162
00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.020
those of you who prioritize speed and

163
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.880
also want to plank the enemy. which

164
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.940
next is a heavy tank or a

165
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.120
heavyweight tank. yeah. guys. like

166
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.100
made in America. there's a T29. which

167
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.200
looks bigger Wow  Instead of the

168
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.000
small one. the HF. what is it called a light

169
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.040
tank? Then there is the T57 heavy tank. which

170
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.660
is very extraordinary. the long muzzle is

171
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.220
very large. and at the same time. look at the

172
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.500
status of its hiding and reduced mobility.

173
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.600
but its firepower and

174
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.339
high endurance. This is the opposite

175
00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:10.260
of the light tank. For example.

176
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.540
earlier  this speed is

177
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.000
star damage It's slow but

178
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.920
has high destructive power

179
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.959
Well if you want both to be

180
00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:20.820
balanced yes In the middle yes

181
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.160
there is such a thing as a medium tank yes guys

182
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.160
here like the T6 m4a1 share-man this

183
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.600
is also very extraordinary  is a

184
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.820
combination of like tanks and happy tanks

185
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.160
so it's not too late  alu slow but not

186
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.500
too fragile where the stats

187
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.019
are extraordinary for you players

188
00:09:37.019 --> 00:09:38.880
who want a balance between

189
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.740
Offensive and Defensive this class is the most

190
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.019
stable for you. namely the medium tank.

191
00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:45.000
besides there is also a special class. namely the tank

192
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.740
Destroyer or tank destroyer like

193
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.360
this.  is a class that is

194
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.399
very difficult to play

195
00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:52.380
with strange shapes but yes with

196
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.880
the Destroyer tank this is a

197
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.920
special class where Here it is more like

198
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.800
Sniper it falls so it is

199
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.839
very slow but can destroy

200
00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:03.360
and penetrate all kinds of armor Tanks are

201
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.940
a bit tricky but  it's

202
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.740
incredibly satisfying if you can

203
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.540
play it like that. so it's

204
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.600
more like parking and looking for targets

205
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.459
and the last one is the SPG class. yeah.

206
00:10:14.459 --> 00:10:16.260
guys. or self propelled guns. this

207
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.180
is a tank class. which is very unique. more

208
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.399
to support falling. yes. this

209
00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:22.019
shape will also be different  himself

210
00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:24.300
because his function is to

211
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.519
memb  offensive counter from a long distance and the

212
00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:28.200
area of ​​damage is bigger the

213
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.880
range is farther It's just

214
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.220
because of the armor and the Durability look at

215
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.600
it it's really very small this is

216
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.399
usually in the back and

217
00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:38.279
of course this is true ee

218
00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:39.959
usually support units or auxiliary units

219
00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:42.240
like that and yeah  Apart from the five classes.

220
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.800
we can also choose tanks from

221
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.899
various countries with their uniqueness.

222
00:10:45.899 --> 00:10:48.839
such as America. Japan. China. then there is

223
00:10:48.839 --> 00:10:51.060
also England. France. and see.

224
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.680
each of them has its own tag tree

225
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.500
or what is it called. eee. there is a lot of extraordinary research.

226
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.240
so there are lots of

227
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.339
customizations you can upgrade.  according

228
00:10:59.339 --> 00:11:01.079
to your wishes the maneuvers are

229
00:11:01.079 --> 00:11:02.880
changed or the speed is increased

230
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.260
so there are lots of things that you can

231
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.180
customize to your liking

232
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.100
so there are lots of choices that

233
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.899
you can play with the

234
00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:12.660
various combinations of tanks that you dream of

235
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.980
and you are curious how

236
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.920
exciting it is to fight between 30  more map

237
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.140
that  different from Tyren and

238
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.839
the weather effects that will affect

239
00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:23.519
